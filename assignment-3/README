This project  is a script that create a simple conversation between friends, familiy members 
or co workers, talking about what they did this weekend and their plans for the next weekend. 

The code is made by diffenrent patterns, so questions in pattern 1 will get an answer for pattern 1, and not an answer that we made for pattern 2. 

Here is one example:
const pattern_1 = ['What are u doing this friday?', 'What is your plans for the weekend?'];


function patter_1_answer() {
  return choice(['Hmmm', 'Ehh']) + ' ' + 'I am ' + choice(['seeing', 'meeting']) + ' ' 
    + choice(['someone', 'a date', 'my mother', 'a friend', 'it is none of your business']) + ' '
    + choice(ponctuation);
}


The answer you will get is always different.

To test the script we used the http://localhost:8088/ where we write our questions and get the different answers.
